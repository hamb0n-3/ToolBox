### Scenario
Red Team engagement

Discovered an exposed web service on a weird port. After enumerating the service we had determined that the Service was iStatistica Pro.
### Attack Vector
The authentication mechanism checks for the cleartext passkey in a “passkey” header. An HTTP GET request is made to the _/api_ URI. With no user account required and no visible lockout policy ---> Password Attack
### Important Takeaways
- Use local copy of software to test "Offline"
- Check default password, possible misconfigurations, etc.
- HTTP & api request capture
- "Follow the traffic" 
- Accidentally discovered DoS vulnerability.

- **Reponsible Discolure reporting**
